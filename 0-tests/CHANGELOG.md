- Restyled the popup shell, tabs, and action rows to follow the Electric Glass cyan HUD aesthetic and improved responsive spacing.
- Recalibrated popup sizing, section spacing, and action trays so every tab keeps controls accessible without overlaps.

## 2025-09-17
- Expanded the popup canvas and retuned the glass card, tab rail, and scroll regions for a wider neon HUD layout without clipped controls.
- Tightened responsive breakpoints for stacks, toolbars, and chips so compact widths no longer overlap action buttons.
