# Debrief

- Reconfirmed the `.4nt` format (salt + iv + ciphertext + tag) with the bundled sample so the Brave restore flow derives the AES-GCM key from `4utotroph` correctly.
- Replaced the blocking `window.prompt` flow with the persistent password field so the popup stays open while the user types credentials.
- Added reactive password validation that reuses the decrypted cookie cache, surfaces counts, and clears stale password errors as soon as the input changes.
- Retained the PBKDF2/AES-GCM regression coverage in `0-tests/decrypt-restore-check.js` to guarantee the sanitized cookie payload stays compatible with `chrome.cookies.set`.
