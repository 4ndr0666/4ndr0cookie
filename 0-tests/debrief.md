# Debrief

- Verified the `.4nt` archive structure and reproduced the popup closing issue triggered by attempting to restore without a preset password.
- Refactored the restore path to inspect the selected payload, prompt the operator for credentials only when required, and reuse the Brave cookie sanitiser.
- Confirmed the UI exposes the restore button once a file is selected so the password prompt can appear during execution.
- Added automated coverage via `0-tests/decrypt-restore-check.js` to decrypt the provided sample with PBKDF2/AES-GCM and assert every cookie normalises into Brave-compatible `chrome.cookies.set` details.
- Validated the AES-GCM tag handling splits and URL/path sanitisation prevent malformed payloads from closing the extension popup.
